      <description>is what I needed. At least I think so. I thought about having a personal landing site with an included blog and listings of my current and finished projects for quite some time.
When I found Hugo and learned about GitHub Pages I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist and published a first draft of what shall become my home on the web. The Landing page design was done in mere seconds with the Hugo theme coder and the rest of the page will follow within a few days.</description>
